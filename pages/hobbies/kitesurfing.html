            Kitesurfing
        </h1>
        <p>
            Kitesurfing is a water sport where you use a kite to ride over the water with a board
        </p>
        <p>
            I got introduced to Kitesurfing in 2019 when a friend from Germany came to visit Cape Town
        </p>
        <p>
            I saw him riding the waves and flying in the air, and said "I want to do that too!"
        </p>
        <p>
            Even though I'm still a beginner, I can now ride the board and control the kite. Soon I'll be doing tricks in the air!
