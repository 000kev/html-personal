    <h1>Proud Husky Papa</h1>
    <p>My dog Oya is my partner-in-crime and a walking, singing teddy bear</p>
    <p>
      She is 4 years old and I got her when she was 14 weeks old and we've been
      together ever since
    </p>
    <p>
      We go on walks and hikes together. Go to the beach together and even eat
      dinner together and sleep in the same bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She is super friendly and gets a lot of attention whenever we go out for
      walks. She thinks every dog is her friend which is sometimes a problem...
