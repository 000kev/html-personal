        <p>
            I started reading at a very young age and it has always been something that I've loved.
        </p>
        <p>
            I love storytelling and writing and am always amazed at the stories that people continuosly come up with.
        </p>
        <p>
            I read books from everywhere of every genre. From short comics, to short stories, to mangas, to novels, I read them all!
        </p>
        <p>
            These are only some of the kinds of things that I read and this list doesn't even cover half, but should give you a good enough idea.
